As the insurer of the bank&#039;s deposits, the fdic pays deposit insurance to the depositors up to the insurance limit. Fdic deposit insurance coverage depends on two things: Since 1933, the fdic seal has symbolized the safety and security of our nation&#039;s financial institutions. Fdic deposit insurance enables consumers to confidently place their money at thousands of fdic insured banks across the country, and is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government. The fdic does not insure all accounts. If you&#039;re seeking a higher return, you may want to consider investment opportunities that sacrifice some safety. The fdic wants to make sure it can cover everyone with a bank account, so to make that happen, it caps how much money it insures. See full list on fdic.gov How much money is protected by fdic?</p>
