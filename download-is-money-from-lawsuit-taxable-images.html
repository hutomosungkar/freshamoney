Perhaps you were injured in a car accident, or filed suit against a prior employer for wrongful termination and are now receiving a monetary settlement. Generally speaking, payments for personal injury or property damage are not taxable, but recoveries for punitive damages or lost wages/income are taxable. This means typical personal injury damages that are meant. While the rules regarding the taxability of monetary awards and settlements—like most areas of taxation—are nuanced and somewhat complicated, the simple answer is that the irs does not consider monetary awards stemming from personal injury claims to be taxable income, so long as the money is not compensation for medical costs or other expenses previously reported as tax deductions. Compensatory damages make up the bulk of wrongful death awards. For example, lost profits are treated as taxable income. An important exception to note, however, is that while the irs will not tax compensatory damages for a wrongful death or personal injury claim, it will tax punitive damages. Remember, according to the irs gross income includes all income from whatever source derived. If you get laid off at work and sue seeking wages, you&#039;ll be taxed as wages, and probably some pay on a form 1099 for emotional distress.</p>
