        <p><h3 id="configuration-of-configtoml">If you choose a 401k loan, you can avoid paying taxes on the money you take from your 401k, but you have to pay that money back.</h3><br>Loans and withdrawals from workplace savings plans (such as 401 (k)s or 403 (b)s) are different ways to take money out of your plan. The minimum age when you can withdraw money from a 401(k) is 59 ½. Withdrawing money before that age results in a penalty worth 10% of the amount you withdraw. Traditional 401k withdrawals are subject to taxation at your ordinary income tax rate. There&#039;s an exception if you leave your company after age 55. When you start pulling money from your 401 (k), the money you take out is taxed as ordinary income. If your situation is uncomplicated, you can expect to receive the check within days. Taking an early withdrawal from your 401 (k) should only be done as a last resort. However, once you reach that magic number, you can feel free to take withdrawals to cover living expenses and other financial needs. This is in addition to the federal and state income taxes you pay on this withdrawal.</p>
