See full list on gamingexploits.com How does geralt make money in the witcher 3? Travel to one of these monster nests and kill the monsters surrounding it. This can be anything you like but to make the most money, leave behind a common, grey item such as a skull. Each monster nest can contain some valuable bits and pieces including some valuable glyphs and runestones which can be worth hundreds! I do this to earn money on the game. If you already know about bombs and have some that can destroy monsters nests then skip to part 4 of this guide. Take your new loot to a vendor and sell it.
